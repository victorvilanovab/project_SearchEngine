flies up is a simple variant of american football that is popular in schoolyards and typically involves one flier who throws the football to a group of catchers each individually attempting to best each other and catch flies passes that have not hit the ground out of the air for points 

once a single catcher catches three flies they do not usually need to be consecutive he or she becomes the new flier and a new game is played in which the prior flier joins the rest of the catchers this can go on for a long time making  flies up a perpetual game that can be played indefinitely in some versions players make it interesting by playing until a specific moment or time in which the current flier at the time is named champion
