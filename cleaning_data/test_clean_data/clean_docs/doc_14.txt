alternative education also known as nontraditional education or educational alternative is a broad term which may be used to refer to all forms of education outside of traditional education for all age groups and levels of education this may include both forms of education designed for students with special needs ranging from teenage pregnancy to intellectual disability and forms of education designed for a general audience which employ alternative educational philosophies andor methods 
alternatives of the latter type are often the result of education reform and are rooted in various philosophies that are commonly fundamentally different from those of traditional compulsory education while some have strong political scholarly or philosophical orientations others are more informal associations of teachers and students dissatisfied with certain aspects of traditional education these alternatives which include charter schools alternative schools independent schools and homebased learning vary widely but often emphasize the value of small class size close relationships between students and teachers and a sense of community
in certain places especially in the united states the term alternative may largely refer to forms of education catering to at risk students or students with other kinds of special needs as it is for example in this definition drafted by the massachusetts department of education  other words used in place of alternative by many educational professionals include nontraditional nonconventional or nonstandardized although these terms are used somewhat less frequently and may have negative connotations and multiple meanings those involved in forms of education which differ in their educational philosophy as opposed to their intended pupil base often use words such as authentic holistic and progressive as well however these words each have different meanings which are more specific or more ambiguous than simply alternative
 overview 
while pedagogical controversy is very old alternative education presupposes some kind of orthodoxy which the alternative is in opposition to  in general this limits the term to the last two or perhaps three centuries with the rise of standarized and later compulsory education at the primary and secondary levels  many critics in this period have suggested that the education of young people should be undertaken in radically different ways than ones in practice  in the th century the swiss humanitarian johann heinrich pestalozzi the american transcendentalists amos bronson alcott ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau the founders of progressive education john dewey and francis parker and educational pioneers such as maria montessori and rudolf steiner founder of the waldorf schools among others all insisted that education should be understood as the art of cultivating the moral emotional physical psychological and spiritual aspects of the developing child  anarchists such as leo tolstoy and fransisco ferrer y guardia emphasized education as a force for political liberation secularism and elimination of class distinctions 
more recently social critics such as john caldwell holt paul goodman frederick mayer and ivan illich have examined education from more individualist anarchist and libertarian perspectives that is critiques of the ways that they feel conventional education subverts democracy by molding young peoples understandings other writers from the revolutionary paulo freire to american educators like herbert kohl and jonathan kozol have criticized mainstream western education from the viewpoint of their varied leftliberal and radical politics
 modern forms 
a wide variety of educational alternatives exist at the elementary secondary and tertiary levels of education these generally fall into four major categories school choice alternative school independent school and homebased education these general categories can be further broken down into more specific practices and methodologies 
 school choice 
the public school options include entirely separate schools in their own settings as well as classes programs and even semiautonomous schools within schools public school choice options are open to all students in their communities though some have waiting lists among these are charter schools combining private initiatives and state funding and magnet schools which attract students to particular themes such as performing arts
 alternative school 
in education the phrase alternative school sometimes referred to as a minischool or remedial school is any public or private school having a special curriculum especially an elementary or secondary school offering a more flexible program of study than a traditional school  a wide range of philosophies and teaching methods are offered by alternative schools some have strong political scholarly or philosophical orientations while others are more adhoc assemblies of teachers and students dissatisfied with some aspect of traditional education  today alternative schools cater to students who have special educational needs as well as those who would like to experience school differently  there are similar programs that exist in higher education settings that serve adults returning to school
 independent school 
independent or private schools have more flexibility in staff selection and educational approach the most plentiful of these are montessori schools waldorf schools the latter are also called steiner schools after their founder and friends schools other independent schools include democratic or free schools such as sands school summerhill school and sudbury valley school krishnamurti schools open classroom schools those based on experiential education as well as schools which teach using international curriculum such as the international baccalaureate and round square schools an increasing number of traditionally independent school forms now also exist within staterun public education this is especially true of the waldorf and montessori schools the majority of independent schools offer at least partial scholarships
 homebased education 
families who seek alternatives based on educational philosophical or religious reasons or if there appears to be no nearby educational alternative can decide to have homebased education some call themselves unschoolers for they follow an approach based on interest rather than a set curriculum others enroll in umbrella schools which provide a curriculum to follow many choose this alternative for religiousbased reasons but practitioners of homebased education are of all backgrounds and philosophies
 correctional education 
 other 
there are also some interesting grey areas for instance homeeducators have combined to create resource centers where they meet as often as five or more days a week but their members all consider themselves homeeducated in some states publicly run school districts have set up programs for homeschoolers whereby they are considered enrolled and have access to school resources and facilities 
also many traditional schools have incorporated methods originally found only in alternative education into their general approach so the line between alternative and mainstream education is continually becoming more blurred
 internationally 
 canada 
in canada some privately run schools receive government school funding 
the toronto district school board has adopted alternative programs into their school system sometimes these take the form of entire schools like mountview alternative school which shares space with the much larger keele elementary school in torontos high parkjunction and sometime they are programs within schools like the triangle program canadas only high school program designed especially for gay lesbian bisexual and transgender students
then there are also schools like divine class a holistic nonschool that guides and certifies average people aged  how to read people situations and events through alternative methods such as tarot psychic ability and esoteric systems
