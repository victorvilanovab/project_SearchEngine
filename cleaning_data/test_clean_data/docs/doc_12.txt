Centennial Scarborough is a neighbourhood located in Toronto, more specifically in Scarborough.  The neighbourhood is bounded by Kingston Rd to the North, Port Union Rd to the East, Scarborough Shoreline (Lake Ontario) to the South and Highland Creek to the West. 

The largest segment of this neighbourhood is much more commonly known as Port Union, which was the name of the waterfront village that stood here in the 1800s.  When railroads came in Port Union did not fare well, however, in recent years a sub division has been built along the waterfront which joins the traditional neighbourhood to the new frontier.  

The neighbourhood has many mature trees, parkland and waterfront.  It is not among the most affluent neighbourhoods in the city but it is an upper middle class neighbourhood with 93% ownership.  For those who want to feel like they are in the country while in the city, this neighbourhood fits the bill.
