Middle Shabele (Somali: Shabeellaha Dhexe;  ) is an administrative region (gobolka) in southern Somalia. As part of the former Benadir region, its capital was Mogadishu until the mid 1980s, when the town of Jowhar became the capital. It is bordered by the Somalian regions of Galguduud, Hiiraan, Lower Shabele, and Banaadir and the Indian Ocean.

It is named after the river Shabeelle that passes this region.
