Oingo Boingo is the first official release from the band Oingo Boingo. This was also the first release of the song "Only A Lad."  In a cost saving move, the label chose to release the band's demo recordings rather than paying for a studio session.  The song selection includes three original compositions by Danny Elfman as well as a ska inflected cover of bluesman Willie Dixon's "Violent Love."  The song "Only A Lad" was subsequently re-recorded and issued as the title track on their first long playing album.

The cover includes an illustration of a cat by artist Louis Wain from the later stages of his schizophrenia.
