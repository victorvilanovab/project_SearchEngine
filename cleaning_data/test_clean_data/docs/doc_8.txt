The economy of Stamford, Connecticut is unusual for having a cluster of corporate headquarters (many of which moved from New York in the 1980s both to lower their tax bill and to be closer to the homes of their top executives). 

The city has four Fortune 500 Companies, nine Fortune 1000 Companies, and thirteen Courant 100 Companies, as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives Stamford one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the nation.

Royal Bank of Scotland announced in October 2005 that it would consolidate its North American headquarters in downtown Stamford and build the largest trading floor in North America (the current largest trading floor is in the UBS building across the street from where the new building is under construction).
